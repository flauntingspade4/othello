# Othello
This is an implementation of the classic board game 'Othello' or 'Reversi' in rust, using the crate [`ggez`](https://ggez.rs/)

The game aims to be all-in-one, a small binary that can be easily downloaded and played between two people, with the following commands:

* r - Restarts the game, displaying who won
* s - Skips a turn, in such a situation where a turn must be skipped
* escape - shuts down the game
